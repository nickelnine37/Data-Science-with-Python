    "Hello and welcome to the second week of the Python course! In this lab notebook we will be looking at the topics covered in the lecture. It is split into three exercises, one about `input()` and conditions, the second about loops, and the third about functions. Remember, if you get stuck for a while you can always check the answers notebook which is in the same folder. \n",

    "The goal of this exercise is to design a program for classifying animals into one of five groups, as in the above picture. This will be done by asking the user to think of animal, and then answer some questions about that animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first question we will ask will be \n",

    "> \"Is this animal warm-blooded? (yes/no)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If they answer \"yes\", then we know the animal is either a mammal, a bird or a fish. If they answer \"no\", then we know it is either a reptile or an amphibian. Your task is to design further questions to determine exactly what type the animal is. Once you know what type the animal is, you should print it's type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the code below. Try running it to see what it does. Once you are happy with what is going on, edit it to complete the task. You will need to use `input()` to ask some more questions, and then use the answer to determine what the animal type is using `if-else` statements. \n",

Each item has an original price, which is stored in a list called `prices`. Each item also has a discount, which is stored in a list called `discounts`, which is represented as a percentage. \n",

Then, you will need to use indexing to find the next item, it's original price, and use the discount to calculate the new price. \n",
