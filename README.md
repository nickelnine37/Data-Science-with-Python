This repository holds the materials used during the course *Data Science with Python*, which was part of the larger course *Introduction to Data Science* hosted by The DataKirk. The course consists of weekly sessions and was run in March/April 2021. It is designed to be both an introduction to programming via Python, and an introduction to widely used data science and data visualisation tools. 

Sessions 1,2 and 3 are broken into two sections: a presentation and a lab. The presentation slides can be found as a pdf while the lab is a Jupyter notebook with questions and answers. Sessions 4 and 5 are purely Jupyter Notebooks which were gone through live in class. 

These materials may be freely distributed, but please credit The DataKirk. To find out more about The DataKirk's mission to empower people  with tech skills and to get involved, please visit the website at www.thedatakirk.org.uk.
